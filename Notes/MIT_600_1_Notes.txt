Declarative info: statement of fact
Imperative info: how to

Syntax: is the string legal
Static semantics: does the string have meaning
Semantics: the assigned meaning of a legal syntax string
Scalar types
  Int: Normal integer
  Float: Real number with decimal places
  Bool: Boolean true false
  Nonetype: Has no type

Operators
  -,+ Addition and subtraction
  *,/ Multiplication and division
  // Division to the whole number (leaves off the remainder)
  ** exponential
  % returns the remainder

Basic Structure
  [Object][Operator][Object]

Tests
  > greater than
  >= greater than or equal to
  < less than
  <= less than or equal to
  == equal
  != not equal

Variables (bindings)
  Names that can have values associated with them
  "Name"="value or expression"
  x=2
  x=x*x
  Names should be descriptive
  Some key words can't be used as a name (int, float ...)
  Values can be updated by re-assigning

Strings
  Sequence of characters
  Contained within double or single quotes
  Strings are non-scalar (pieces can be extracted from them)
  Elements start counting at 0
  Elements called using []
    Use [number:number] to call a range
      [number:] calls everything after element number
      [:number] calls everything before element number
    Use [:] to call a copy of a string
      Name=cody
      Name[0]: "c"
      Name[1:3]: "od"
      Name[:]="cody"

Output
  Print: outputs a value to the screen
  A comma will seperate each arugment with a space
  use + to concatenate within operation

Input
  Prints a string as a prompt, takes user input and assigns to bound variable
  Doesn't need quotes to work, will store string with quotes if typed
  Must cast as int or float if using numeric input

Branching Programs
  Used to make choices
  Runs code once
  Test a condition, run one block of code if test is true and another if test is false
  If condition :
    code
  elif 2nd condition :
    code
  else: code

While Loop
  Repeat code until condition is false
  Unknown number of itterations
  Can use counter but must initialize and incriment within loop
  Might not be able to rewrite as a for loop
  While  condition :
    Code to run while true
  Have a variable outside of loop
  Have something that changes variable inside loop
    Otherwise it's an infinite loop

For Loop
  Easier to capture itterations
  Known number of itterations
  Uses a counter, doesn't need initialized or incrimented
  Can rewrite as while loop
  for variable in expression:
    Code

Range()
  incriments to a number
  (Start,Stop,Incriment)
  Default is (0,number,1)

Break
    stops execution of a loop

Itteration
  Still starts with a test  but loops code until test is false
  Repeat a sequence of steps based on a decision
  Allows for guess and check

Guess and Check
  Try all cases until true

Using a loop variable
  Initialized outside loop
  Used to check for completion

Decrementing Function
  Maps program variables to intigers
  Starts at a non-negative value and decreases each time loop runs
  Loop ends when variable <=0

Possible Errors
  Forgot to initialize
    Using a variable inside a loop that doesn't exist outside of it
    NameError
    Stops
  Forgot to change variable
    Infinite loop!!!
